# Sampling 
By: **MRITUNJAY-102003030**

## Overview
* Sampling is a method that allows us to get information about the population based on the statistics from a subset of the population (sample), without having to investigate every individual.
* Sampling is done to draw conclusions about populations from samples, and it enables us to determine a populationâ€™s characteristics by directly observing only a portion (or sample) of the population. 
  * Selecting a sample requires less time than selecting every item in a population
  * Sample selection is a cost-efficient method
  * Analysis of the sample is less cumbersome and more practical than an analysis of the entire population

## **Models Used**
The five different models used for predicting results are:
1. M1->Logistic Regression
2. M2->Support Vector Machine
3. M3->Decision Tree Classifier
4. M4->Gaussian Naive Bayes
5. M5->KNeighbors
